You're planning a vacation, and you need to decide which city you want to visit. You have shortlisted four cities and

|Mumbai|450              |10               |70			 |


Answer the following questions using the data above:

1) If you're planning a 1-week long trip, which city should you visit to spend the least amount of money?
